Lab03:: Search
2021-12-20
Time Spent: 6 hours

DISCO:
- currentTimeMillis() returns a long of the current time.
- Java Heap Space is the amount of memory allocated to java in which it can store instantiated objects
- Making lab logs to log your every step is a key part of learnination in computer science
- How to derive a plan and enact that plan in code 
- How to test a hypothesis using at first pseudo code and then real code

QCC:
- How would we easily show that the relationship changes as the length of the array changes? Does time/length work?
- How many computations per second do our computers do?
- How does currentTimeMillis() work?
- Does currentTimeMillis() take a significant amount of time?
- Exactly how long does Systen.out.print() take?

GALLERY TOUR:
- NYA
  - Used a constuctor to instaniate and populate the array
- Four
  - Used three different tests to test different things
  - Tested after how many searches binary search becomes faster than linear search
    - This found that binary search will always become more efficient than linear search eventually
- ABA
  - Binary search is faster than linear search for all of their tests
  - They linked an image into their README.md and say they did it by dragging it

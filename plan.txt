Lab03--Plan :D
2021-12-16
time spent: .4 hrs

Plan:
First, what is our end goal?
The hypothesis says "Relative to the size of the dataset, binary search is faster than linear search". Due to this hypothesis, I am led to assume that we are going to test BinSearch vs LinSearch 
in different array sizes, presumably all the way until we can map out the relationship.

Implementation:

Utilize the currentTimeMillis method given to us as a resource on the lab03 stuycs page in order to compare the times before and after running a Bin/Lin Search and comparing it to the same search in the opposite method. 

Example implementation:
long x= currenttimemillis();
return long currenttimemillis()-x; //at the end of both Bin and LinSearch as we have already tested functionality and do not need to return the indez

In order to control for any randomness/luck, we search for the element at each index in each array.(IE: [1,2,3] should be 4 searches, [1,2,3,4,5] should be 6 searches (one search extra for if an int is not there)

Afterwards, we divide the difference in time (for each class) by the length of the array (our time per index searched). Our hope is to see that, as the size gets bigger, BinSearch exponentially becomes faster, ultimately proving our hypothesis

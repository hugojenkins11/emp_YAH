Our first idea of implementation was to subtract the differences of times between binsearch and linsearch

We reread the hypothesis, realizign that we need to create a correlation between size and time difference. Now looking at showing the time divided by the size (time per index searched basically)

Discussing our end goal again, how we are going to prove that size makes BinSearch more fast than LinSearch

Pushed our changes during class onto the repo to check the boxes of what needs to be there by Friday end of class, forgot to push it during class

Reconvening, ran into issues with types of arrays, found out that we can initialize arrays as comparable and still have them maintain any functionality we please

We realized how quick Java runs, rendering our time difference obsolete up to ~1000 elements. We devised a plan, which allowed for our code to handle arrays up to 67 million elements, giving us significant times to run with (exclusively for BinarySearch as of now)

We are trying to figure out how many times to run linSearch and binSearch because it is taking too long. We also noticed that it seems that Math.random() takes a good amount of time.

We are hypothesizing that finding the middle element of an array takes the average amount of time to find all of the array's elements because it is exactly between the worst and best case scenario.

As we near the end of this journey, we start to ponder what we have learned. The friends we have made along the way are evidence of our learnination.

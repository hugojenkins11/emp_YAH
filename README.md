## Tests Performed:

In order to try to find the total time it would take, we tried multiple tests to build up to our big test. Our first attempt was to see if running a linsearch for the middle element and multiplying by the entire amount of elements. After doing so, we found that it was approximately the same amount of time to do so. Knowing this, we performed 2 main tests. One of them was to find the linearsearch using the middle element and the other one found it using 20 searches.
